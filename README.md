# SteganoGraphy
It is basic model of Steganography which was developed by me during chat room project as a mode of encrypting the messages into media files.

Steganography is nothing but hiding data into various media files and then sending it to someone, than only reciever will have the way to extract the data from the media file recieved. It is a way of encryption and secure transmission of important data.

During the development of chat room project, first I decided to use this method as encryption of messages but the sharing of media files was not efficient for each message.
So the plan to use this as a encryption method was dropped then we decided to go with FMS Attack method.

It is developed using  PIL library and we use an algorithm to play with binary conversion of pixels and then encrypting the data into it. 

GUI for this is also well developed and is easy to use.
